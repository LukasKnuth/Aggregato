# Aggregato

This is a project I worked on for my Bachelor degree.

It uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to fetch TV Show information regularly.
Users can add shows to their watchlist and the system will check for new episodes and send push notifications to the companion Android app.

## Tech

It was written for Google App Engine and used [objectify](https://github.com/objectify/objectify) as it's storage backend.

This was my first touchpoint with Cloud technologies and non-relational databases.
